A Discord bot to assist with the PTL discord server. 

### Prerequisites

discord.py 1.0 
sqlite3
```

### Installing

From your preferred terminal,

Check your python version

```
><> python --version

Install the python packages that will be used for this project. *I would suggest using a virtualenv*
